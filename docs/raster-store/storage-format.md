# Storage format

> **Status:** future raster-store design. The completed 2D/3D store refactor
> did not implement or finalize the RF/TB formats described below. These
> requirements were not acceptance criteria for that refactor. See
> [refactor-status.md](refactor-status.md) for the implemented shared boundary.

The 3D octree stores now use the versioned envelope formats described in
[envelope-migration-plan.md](envelope-migration-plan.md). The shared store
still supplies only an in-memory `raster_store::StoreTraits` adapter for
`radix::tile::Id`; there is currently no persistent RF index, `.amort` codec,
snapshot publisher, or RF opening API. Names and formats below remain
proposals until their own implementation plans approve them.

This document specifies the logical format and required invariants for the following data stores:
- raster-fundamentalis (our authoritative raster store)
- tile-base (the tile-pyramid for our tile-server)
- the source-attribution table (for correct copyright attribution and data selection)

## Source-attribution table
The source attribution table is used in raster-fundamentalis, tile-base, and in abbreviated format in the delivered tiles. 
- stores a vector of structs (called Table), each struct describing one source
- the struct (called Entity) contains:
 - the spatial resolution in pixel-width at the equator (EPSG:3857)
 - the date of data acquisition
 - the date of ingestion
 - a copyright string
 - a copyright link string
 - a license string
- the index 0 is reserved for "no-data"
- the index must be checked to be smaller than 2^16-1, and we throw unsupported if it becomes larger (this is because of the storage format of tiles).
- the source attribution table is implemented in src/terrainlib/source_attribution.h, in the namespace source_attribution::*
- We need a `struct` declaration and a `using Table = .. ` (both versioned)
- the source-attributino table is stored in a file named source_attribution_table.ard (.alpine raster data)
- there is one per directory tree (it's valid for all tiles stored within the same directory tree, all siblings and children).
- given a tile (either rf or tb), the lookup of the source attribution table is first in the same directory and then in all parrent dirs, until a source_attribution_table.ard is found (or a failure is thrown).

## alpine maps raster store format
this is the binary format used to store rf and tb tiles. both share the same basic tile format, but use it in different ways.
- The hierarchy is a Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) quadtree keyed by tile IDs (radix::tile::ID, https://docs.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/).
- stored tiles have a resolution of 4096x4096 pixels
- Every stored pixel has one data value (can be vector type) and one source attribution index.
- the source attribution index is stored as uint16, and indexes into a global source attribution table (see above)
- data is stored in radix::Raster<Type> objects (one for source attribution index, one for the actual data), i.e. template <typename PixelType> struct raster_store::Tile { radix::Raster<PixelType> data; radix::Raster<uint16> source_attribution; };
- the file ending is .amort (AlpineMapsOrg raster tile), it is serialised used the principles outlined below.
- each snapshot stores its index as `raster_store.index`.
- the default `zoom/x/y_google` layout stores a tile as
  `<zoom>/<x>/<y>.amort`, directly below the snapshot root.

## raster-fundamentalis (rf) format
raster-fundamentalis is our authoritative raster-store, containing only the data and no overviews / downsampled version.
- unlike a tile pyramid, not every level is occupied (there is no downsampled versions of the data).
- Coarse physical tiles (e.g. zoom level 10) may coexist with more accurate descendants (e.g. zoom level 15).
- the raster-fundamentalis builder is implemented in src/rf-builder/*, it consumes raw gdal data.

## Tile-base Format (tb)
tile-base is a hierarchy build from raster-fundamentalis, containing all data and its overviews / downsampled versions. it is used directly by the tile-server to generate tiles at the requested resolution and format.
- every level is occupied, and every level selects an adequate data source
- the tile-base builder is implemented in src/tb-builder, it consumes rf

### tile-server
- should generate tiles of requested resolution and pixel type (vertex|area) on the fly
- requests by url, e.g.: layer/vertex|area/resolution/z/x/y.ending
- live in src/tile-server/*
- the delivery tile format is not yet defined 

## serialization / deserialization envelope and versioning
- `zpp::bits` serialises C++ objects to byte streams and deserialises them again.
- The envelope is generic and is not specific to the raster store.
- We serialise objects with `zpp::bits` in two levels.
 - The first level is an aggregate with the following fields, in this order:
  - `uint64 magic`, always `F5FBD3EF919428CA`, identifying this envelope format;
  - `string class_name`, identifying the payload type;
  - `uint32 class_version`, identifying the versioned payload type;
  - `ChecksumAlgorithm checksum_algorithm`, default `HandledByCompressionLib`, alternatively `Crc32c` or `None`;
  - `string checksum`, empty when no external checksum is used, otherwise the CRC-32C value;
  - `CompressionAlgorithm compression_algorithm`, default `ZstdDefaultCompressionWithChecksum`, alternatively `ZstdBestCompressionWithChecksum` or `None`;
  - `uint64 uncompressed_size`, the exact size of the uncompressed second level;
  - `Bytes compressed_data`, containing the second level.
 - The second level is a compressed byte vector. It is deserialised directly into the selected versioned payload class.
- The magic is shared by all payload types. `class_name` distinguishes payload types. An incompatible future envelope layout requires a new magic.
- data structs are stored in versioned namespaces, e.g.:
  `raster_store::v1::Tile`
- outside the versioned namespace, there is a using declaration for the newest version
- outside the versioned namespace, there is a serialization wrapper function taking only the newest version
- outside the versioned namespace, there is a deserialization function, taking a byte stream, and returning the newest version (convert to the newest version, if the payload encodes an older version)
- Newer versions provide a static `from_previous` function, e.g. `v2::Tile::from_previous(v1::Tile)`. Static conversion functions keep the payload types aggregates, allowing `zpp::bits` to serialise them without per-type serialisation declarations. A conversion trail upgrades v1 to v2 and then v3.
- `Version<Number, VersionedPayloadType>` pairs version numbers with payload types. `PayloadSchema<ClassName, Versions...>` defines the class name, supported versions, latest type, and conversion trail.
- The generic serialisation function receives the schema and version as template parameters. Deserialisation reads `class_version`, deserialises exactly that payload type, and follows the conversion trail to the latest type. It does not speculatively try other payload versions.
- we have clear fails if
 - the classname or magic is wrong, or the version is unsupported
 - if the checksum check fails
 - if the compression algorithm is missing or unsupported.
 - deserialization fails
- we fail by returning an unexpected in these cases
- Compression uses libzstd at its default compression level. Libzstd is imported through the project's CMake install facility from https://github.com/AlpineMapsOrgDependencies/zstd. Both zstd modes write an embedded frame checksum, which libzstd verifies while decompressing; `ZstdBestCompressionWithChecksum` remains available for explicit callers.
- `compress_with_checksum` accepts a `vector<byte>` and returns the compressed bytes plus the external checksum string. `checked_decompress` accepts both and returns the decompressed bytes. Both use `std::expected` and dispatch with a switch.
- `Crc32c` is an external CRC-32C (Castagnoli) checksum of the complete uncompressed serialised payload. It uses the reflected polynomial `82F63B78`, an initial value of `FFFFFFFF`, and a final XOR of `FFFFFFFF`. The checksum string contains exactly eight lowercase hexadecimal characters. The empty payload has checksum `00000000`; the ASCII test vector `123456789` has checksum `e3069283`. CRC-32C detects accidental corruption but is not cryptographic.
- `checked_decompress` accepts a maximum decompressed size, defaulting to 1 GiB. It uses a size reported by the compression format when available, otherwise it uses the maximum as its allocation bound and shrinks the result to the produced size.
- Envelope deserialisation passes `uncompressed_size` as that maximum and requires the produced size to match it exactly. A mismatch is a decompression failure. A declared size above the caller's limit or the hard 1 GiB limit is a size-limit failure.
- `None` compression may be paired with `None` or `Crc32c`. Either zstd mode may be paired with `HandledByCompressionLib` or `Crc32c`; with `Crc32c`, both the embedded zstd checksum and the external CRC-32C are checked. `HandledByCompressionLib` is invalid with `None` compression, and `None` checksum is invalid with a zstd mode.
- `None` and `HandledByCompressionLib` require an empty checksum string. `Crc32c` requires its canonical eight-character checksum. Deserialisation verifies it after bounded decompression and before parsing the payload with `zpp::bits`; envelope deserialisation also requires the resulting size to exactly match `uncompressed_size`.
- Decompression never allocates or produces output larger than 1 GiB.


## to be defined
- semantic layer kind (height scalars, linear colour, gamma-encoded colour, categorical values), should be used for filtering
- human readable description?
- enumeration of layers etc?

For now, these things will be defined in code, we will have one terrain-elevation, one surface-elevation and one ortho-photo store. later probably also a percentage store (for the snow layer)
