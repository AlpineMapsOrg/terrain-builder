# Architecture

This document describes the responsibilities and lifecycle of raster-store
(RS), raster-fundamentalis (RF), tile-base (TB), and the tile-server.
Raster-store provides geospatial raster tile storage for the alpine maps
project on top of the shared store mechanisms also used for 3D meshes. It is
part of the `terrainlib` target.

[Storage format](storage-format.md) defines the directory layout, serialized
data, and format invariants. [Terminology](terminology.md) defines the domain
language.

## System boundary

The design separates authoritative data management from delivery generation:

```text
Input rasters (e.g. GDAL)
    │
    │ inspect, transform to Web Mercator, define source, one source per pixel -> rf_builder
    ▼
raster-fundamentalis (one rf per source at the beginning)
    │
    │ rf_merger: merge two rf stores based on attribution priority list
    ▼
Authoritative rf raster store
    │
    │ generate overviews using defined filtering strategy.
    ▼
tile-base store (one per channel; every build is a new snapshot, the server needs one version per channel)
    ├── read by tile-server
    ├── area/vertex pixel tile generation
    └── select resolution, type etc by url
```

## Dataset organization

RF and tile-base use the same storage format but live under separate roots.
Their different data-selection and hierarchy policies belong to their tools.
Additional metadata can be introduced later using the same envelope mechanism.
See the [directory layout](storage-format.md#directory-layout) for filenames
and the [attribution lookup rules](storage-format.md#source-attribution-table).

RF snapshots normally share an attribution table. TB construction copies that
table unchanged into the output snapshot, preserving indices. This copy is
independent of the mutable RF table, so later edits or RF removal do not
affect it. The complete TB can then be transferred by rsync as one directory.
An RF snapshot using an ancestor table depends on that external table.

The source table is maintained manually. Builders and overview generators
consume entries without editing or renumbering them. A user may correct an
entry or clear its field values while retaining the complete object. Reusing
an index requires the user to establish that no retained snapshot using that
table refers to it; the library does not track this lifecycle. The required
entry structure is specified in the storage format. See also the
[shared-table decision](../adr/0001-shared-raster-attribution-table.md).

## Snapshot lifecycle

Datasets may be several TiB in size, so builds and merges can take days or
weeks. The RF builder, RF merger, and TB builder follow these policies:

- Every build or merge generates a new snapshot; published snapshots are
  never mutated.
- Errors abort the build.
- Builders checkpoint the index at least every few minutes so an aborted
  build remains readable as a cache.
- Callers may supply a cache store from an earlier or aborted run to skip
  processing nodes that can be reused.
- Reusable tiles are hard-linked to limit storage cost.

Because hard links share inodes, a linked container must never be opened for
in-place modification. Obsolete snapshots can be deleted; other hard links
keep the data alive. Published snapshots are opened read-only.

Hard-link reuse may cross RF and TB roots. The calling tool decides whether
a tile can be reused, including payload type, dimensions, encoding, and
attribution-index compatibility. Storage performs the requested operation
and reports operational failures; it does not add semantic compatibility
checks. A TB with different tile dimensions needs newly generated tiles
wherever existing tiles cannot be reused unchanged. Linked TB payloads and
the independent attribution table remain valid after removing the RF.

### Opening and checkpoints

Normal opening rejects `.part` snapshot directories. An explicit option opens
one read-only for cache reuse, using the last saved index and ignoring
unindexed files. Checkpoint timing belongs to the builder, which explicitly
saves the index periodically.

Checkpoints replace the index through a temporary file so a failed write does
not truncate the previous checkpoint. Destruction may save a dirty index but
never publishes a snapshot. Checkpointing and publication require the caller
to finish outstanding writes first.

Opening and publication do not perform an additional whole-snapshot
validation pass or scan payload files for existence. Errors are reported when
the index or a tile is read.

### Publication

A new snapshot is assembled in a sibling directory named
`<snapshot-id>.part`. Publication follows this protocol:

1. Write all payload and metadata files into the `.part` directory.
2. Write the final index last and flush and close the output files.
3. Rename the directory to `<snapshot-id>` on the same filesystem.

Publication returns success after the rename without reopening the snapshot.
The rename uses Linux `renameat2` with `RENAME_NOREPLACE` to reject
destination collisions; other platforms currently report `Unsupported`.

A `.part` directory is incomplete and is never considered published. There is
no separate marker or manifest. During normal operation this gives readers
atomic visibility: they see either no final snapshot or the completed one.

Cross-filesystem publication is unsupported because the final rename and any
hard links must remain on one filesystem. A builder or merger must reject that
configuration before starting a long operation.

Publication does not guarantee durability or safe recovery across a power
failure, operating-system crash, or storage failure; there is no `fsync()`.
After such a failure, either a `.part` directory or a final snapshot may be
unusable and must be validated or rebuilt.

## Tools

### tb_builder

Tile-base adds overviews to one RF and retains the data. It holds one
channel; derived channels such as shadings are produced by separate tools. Every level is occupied
and selects an adequate source. It must support at least minimum, maximum, and average
aggregation. A TB may choose different tile dimensions from its RF input.

Planned location: `src/tb-builder`.

### tile_server

The server consumes tile-base and generates renderer tiles of the requested
dimensions, sampling placement, and encoding on the fly. Requests identify
these choices in the URL, for example `layer/vertex|area/resolution/z/x/y.ending`.
Output dimensions may be 65px or 256px, with area or vertex pixels.

Delivery encoding is not yet finalized. Required options include JPEG, PNG,
compressed ETC2/DXT1, and compressed raw rasters. Some layers combine several
tile-bases, such as DTM and DSM, or percentage larger than slope angle (PLaTSA),
Phong shading, and AO shading. An ECEF bounding-sphere tree is planned later.

Planned location: `src/tile-server/*`.
